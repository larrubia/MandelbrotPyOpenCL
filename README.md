# Sequential Programming
Algorithm that runs sequential instructions through a single processor.

# Parallel Programming
Algorithm composed of a set of parts that can be solved concurrently. Each part is also constituted by a series of sequential instructions, but which can be executed simultaneously by several processors.

# Parallel Computing
Can be defined as the use simultaneous use of several computational resources in order to reduce the time needed to solve a particular problem. 
These computational resources may include a single computer with multiple processors,an arbitrary number of networked computers or even the combination of both.

# Why Parallel Programming?

Traditionally, parallel programming had as its initial motivation the resolution and simulation of
fundamental problems in science and engineering with scientific and economic importance, known as Grand Challenge Problems - GCPs.

Nowadays, applications require the processing of large volumes of information each faster time. Parallel programming can reduce the time required to solve complex and larger problems, taking advantage of underutilized computational resources locally.
